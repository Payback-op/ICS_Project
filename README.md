1. Data Structures: To represent key entities in a medical context, the application defines a number of structures, including:
struct Date: Shows the day, month, and year of a date.
struct Doctor: Describes a medical professional having a name and area of expertise.
A patient's name, age, gender, contact information, admission and discharge dates, outpatient status, and designated physician are just a few of the attributes that make up the struct Patient.
struct PatientRecord: Compiles a patient's history, the name of their attending physician, and the dates of admission and discharge.
2. Global Arrays and Counters: Patient records, physician information, and patient data are all stored in arrays.
The number of patients, doctors, and records is tracked via global counters (patientCount, doctorCount, recordCount).
3. Main Function and Menu: A loop in the main() function shows the user a menu until they select to depart (by inputting 0).
Options for a number of procedures are available on the menu, such as adding doctors, assigning doctors to patients, searching for patients, registering patients, and showing doctor-patient associations.
4. File Handling: When registering patients, the application employs file handling to save patient data in a file called "file.txt" (registerPatient() function).
Patient data is retrieved from the file and shown on the terminal via the displayPatients() function.
5. Functions`:
a. registerPatient(): Requests patient information from the user.
adds the patient's name, age, gender, contact information, outpatient status, and admission date (if not an outpatient) to the "file.txt" file.
b. displayPatients(): This function pulls data from the "file.txt" file about each patient.
Provides contact details, admission date, name, age, gender, and other patient information on the console.
c. searchPatients(): Accepts a name for the patient as input.
looks for the patient by name and presents their details if it is located.
d. assignDoctor(): Provides a list of patients and physicians that are available.
enables the user to designate a physician for a particular patient.
e. displayDoctorPatientAssociation(): Shows the relationship that patients have with the doctors they have been assigned.
f. addDoctor(): Allows for user input when adding a new physician to the database.
6. General Observations: The code stores and retrieves patient data using a straightforward text file called "file.txt".
For a more reliable system, some input validations, error handling, and functionality like handling discharge dates are lacking and should be improved.
All things considered, this hospital management system offers the bare minimum of features for patient registration, physician addition, and association management. It is an oversimplified example, though, and in a real-world situation, more functionality and reliable error handling would be required.
